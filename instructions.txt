I have written some typescript code and I am learning to convert it into JS
Using typescript compiler installed earlier in step 1
		=> tsc index.ts
			=> this will create compiled version of file as inde.js
			=> to execute I can fo node index.js and file will run on terminal

I tried to execute ts-node index.ts
